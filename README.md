## Environment architecture
The development environment was quite recent to me. So I had to learn everything about docker and its environment. 

It consists of an EC2 instance running a Terraform with 2 Docker images, one for the backend of the code and one for the frontend.

## Reflections

- What did you learn?
  
  Completing this lab was a really difficult experience. It served as a refresher for my JavaScript knowledge. Additionally, it was everything new for me about anything of cloud programming.
- What obstacles did you overcome?
  
  One of the biggest obstacle that I had with this lab was make the .jar file with the backend and frontend divided. Then I had alot of problems trying to solve everything with the docker image and then in the terraform was not creating the EC2.
- What did you help most in overcoming obstacles?
  
  I need to search everything in internet so I learned a lot about how to resolve everything alone. The teacher helped me to understand everything that I didn't have any sense for me.
